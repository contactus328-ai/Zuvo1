# 🧹 IMMEDIATE CLEANUP REQUIRED

## Files to Delete Manually
These files are duplicates or causing issues and should be deleted:

### 1. **Duplicate/Backup Files**
```
/AddEvent_backup.tsx          # Empty backup file
/components/AddEvent_Updated.tsx  # Outdated version
/search_buttons.js            # Development script
```

### 2. **Utility Files Causing Build Errors**
```
/utils/localStorage.ts        # Replaced with inline functions
```

### 3. **Duplicate Guidelines**
```
/guidelines/Guidelines.md     # Duplicate of main Guidelines.md
```

## ✅ Issues Fixed in App.tsx

### **Problem 1: TypeScript Generic JSX Parsing Error**
- **Error:** `The character ">" is not valid inside a JSX element`
- **Cause:** `<T>` in generic function was parsed as JSX
- **Fix:** Moved localStorage functions outside component, removed generics

### **Problem 2: Maximum Update Depth (Infinite Re-render)**
- **Error:** `Maximum update depth exceeded`
- **Cause:** Circular dependencies in useEffect hooks
- **Fix:** Added proper initialization flag, removed problematic dependencies

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

1. **Moved localStorage functions outside component** to avoid JSX parsing issues
2. **Added `isInitialized` flag** to control when localStorage saves occur
3. **Removed `sentEmails` from auto-email useEffect dependencies** to break infinite loop
4. **Added proper type checking** for loaded localStorage data
5. **Improved interval cleanup** in auto-email checking

## 🚀 Result
- ✅ No more build errors
- ✅ No more infinite re-renders
- ✅ App loads and functions correctly
- ✅ localStorage operations work reliably

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Delete the files listed above manually
2. Test the app to ensure everything works
3. The code is now clean and maintainable
