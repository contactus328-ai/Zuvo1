# Cleaned Files Log

## Files to Remove
These files are duplicates or no longer needed:

1. `/AddEvent_backup.tsx` - Empty backup file 
2. `/components/AddEvent_Updated.tsx` - Outdated version
3. `/search_buttons.js` - Development script
4. `/utils/localStorage.ts` - Causing build errors, replaced with inline functions
5. `/guidelines/Guidelines.md` - Duplicate of main Guidelines.md

## Actions Taken
- ✅ Fixed infinite re-render loop in App.tsx
- ✅ Replaced localStorage utility with inline functions  
- ✅ Added initialization flag to prevent save loops
- ✅ Cleaned up imports and dependencies
- ✅ Documented files for manual removal

## Result
- App now loads without errors
- No more maximum update depth warnings
- No more build failures from JSX syntax errors
- Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
